## **Project Description**
Something

**Videre** seeks innovative BCIT SSD students to develop an Angular progressive web application (PWA) that aids life insurance advisors in assessing clients' maximum insurable needs. This project builds upon a validated MVP to expand functionality, enhance user experience, and streamline deployment processes.

## **Key elements include:**

- **Feature Expansion:** Students will utilize Angular and TypeScript to develop new app functionalities.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Implementing static analysis to ensure code reliability (ESLint, Prettier, etc).
- **DevOps Pipeline:** Building a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploying the app to cloud infrastructure
- **Language Model Agent:** Use OpenAI chatbot interface to allow the user interface with the app via a robo-advisor with a customized knowledge base.

This project is an exceptional opportunity to apply a wide array of skills acquired through the SSD program, including but not limited to Angular, TypeScript, DevOps practices, and cloud deployments, in a real-world, market-validated application.

## **Technical Stack:**

- Programming Language(s): Angular & Typescript, Github workflow actions
- Students are encouraged to use TypeScript with Angular for front-end development, embracing the SSD program's focus on modern web technologies.
- The project promotes open-source tools and frameworks, aligning with industry standards for software development and deployment. Emphasis will be placed on utilizing GitHub for version control and collaboration, alongside integrating APIs for enhanced functionalities.

## **Hardware/Software Requirements:**

- Development will utilize open-source tools, with students using their own computing resources.
- The project will leverage existing cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) for deployment, requiring students to have access to standard development tools (IDEs, Git) and an internet connection.
- Videre will provide access to necessary cloud services and APIs.

## **Current Work/Arrangement:**

Currently, the MVP of the financial calculator is functional but requires expansion and refinement for a broader feature set and improved usability. It is built with Angular and deployed to Vercel as a pure front-end app. There is currently no backend database or server. By leveraging Agile methodologies and a robust DevOps pipeline, we intend to streamline development and deployment, ensuring a seamless and scalable solution.
